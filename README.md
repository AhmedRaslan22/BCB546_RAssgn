There are a total of 40 .txt files in this document, 20 for maize and 20 for teosinte. These files are organized in "maize" and "teosinte" folders, and these folders are further divided into two other folders. Each of these folders contain 10 .txt files for each chromosome (1-10). Folders labeled with "chr_increasing" have data organized by increasing SNP position, and those labeled with "chr_decreasing" have data organized by decreasing SNP position. There is also an R Markdown file that contains my code and a description of what the code does ("Burger_R_Assgn.Rmd") as well as an .html format of the same information ("Burger_R_Assgn.html").
